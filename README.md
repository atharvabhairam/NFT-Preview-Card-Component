# NFT Preview Card Component

This project is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) preview card component built as part of a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The component showcases an NFT with details such as its name, description, price, time left for auction, and the creator's information. It is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, with hover effects and interactive elements.

## Features

- **NFT Preview Card**: Displays an NFT image, title, description, price, and time left for auction.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects on the NFT image and text elements.
- **Responsive Design**: The card is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **SVG Icons**: Uses SVG icons for Ethereum and the clock, along with a view icon for the hover effect.
- **Google Fonts Integration**: Utilizes the "Outfit" font from Google Fonts for a modern and clean typography.
